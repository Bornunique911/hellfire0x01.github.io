I am Akshat Gupta, pursuing Computer Science for my undergraduate degree. I have a keen and profound interest in Cyber Security and Hacking especially in Penetration Testing, Red Teaming and Network Security. I love reading articles and blogs, be it technical or non-technical. I am also getting my hands in Blue Team and Cloud Security, slowly but yes.
