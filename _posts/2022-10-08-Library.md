Deploy the machine and quickly scan the ports with rustscan,

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.147.58
```

we get 2 open ports. Lets scan them using nmap,

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p22,80 10.10.147.58 -oN nmap.txt
```

Result scan reveals that port 22 is running ssh service and port 80 is running webserver. Enumerate port 80.

Visit http://10.10.147.58,

we land onto a website. After scrolling down, a username **meliodas** was found and nothing more.

Now, finding hidden directories using dirsearch,

```bash
dirsearch -u http://10.10.147.58 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -i 200,301 2>/dev/null
```

we got 2 path from which robots.txt which seems very interesting.

Visiting http://10.10.147.58/robots.txt,

we got a word **rockyou** which we can use to brute force the password of meliodas user. 

Using hydra, we can brute force the password of meliodas user,

```bash
hydra -l meliodas -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.147.58:22/ -t 4
```

and we got the password.

Now, login via ssh service,

```bash
ssh meliodas@10.10.147.58
```

we got in. 

List directory content, we got our user flag

There is also a file named bak.py which is creating zip file in some directory,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/186571647-e38ff9b3-9c1d-4f08-b551-c8aae6e5f6b5.png)

We got to know that this file's owner is root user.

Now, comes the privilege escalation part. Taking a look at which binaries we can run as sudo,

```bash
sudo -l
```

**/usr/bin/python*** (* means any version of python) can be run as root on /home/meliodas/bak.py. 

Now, what we can do is that remove the content of bak.py and put our one-liner python shell, which when ran with /usr/bin/python, will run as root and we will get us root shell.

Issuing this one liner command,

```bash
echo "import os; os.system("/bin/sh")" > bak.py
```

we got permission denied because we can not write anything into this file. 

But we can remove it and make our own bak.py file using `rm bak.py`.

Now, creating a file and passing one liner python shell into it and viewing the content of file,

Now that everything is set, run the command,

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/meliodas/bak.py
```

and we got root.
